# UART-Controlled-LED-Blink-Bare-Metal---STM32
This project demonstrates bare-metal programming on an STM32 microcontroller, where an LED blinks based on a number received via **UART (USART1)**. The user inputs a number (1-999) through a serial terminal (like PuTTY), and the LED blinks accordingly.
